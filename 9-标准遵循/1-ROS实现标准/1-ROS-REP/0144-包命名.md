# 概述

包越来越多，命名要规范

# 动机

包的数量越来越多，很难通过名字来猜测其功能，所以要指定命名规范

有很多包具备不同的功能属性，有必要用命名规则来进行分类

# 强制规范

包名如果不符合强制规范，则catkin会报警

## 字母选择

由于包名经常用于c++的命名空间，所以命名需要严格指定

- alphanumerics are a-z0-9 only

- alphabetics are a-z only

全部小写，只包括a-z0-9，首部只能是a-z

**A name must:**

- **only consist of lowercase alphanumerics and _ separators and start with an alphabetic character.** This allows it to be used in generated symbols and functions in all supported languages. Lowercase is required because the names are used in directories and filenames and some platforms do not have case sensitive filesystems.

  - 小写，首部必须为a-z，这是为了适配大小写敏感的文件系统

- **not use multiple _ separators consecutively.** This allows generated symbols to use the __ separator to guarenteed the avoidance of collisions with symbols from other packages, for example in the message generators.

  - 不允许连续使用下划线

- **be at least two characters long.** This rule is simply to force the name of the package to be more human understandable. It's recommended to be noteably longer, see below.

  - 最少两个字母长度

  - 推荐尽可能长以表达清除包的含义

- **Package names should be specific enough to identify what the package does.** For example, a motion planner should not be called planner. If it implements the wavefront propagation algorithm, it might be called wavefront_planner. There's obviously tension between making a name specific and keeping it from becoming overly verbose

- **Using catchall names such as** utils **should be avoided.** They do not scope what goes into the package or what should be outside the package

  - 避免使用宽泛的词汇进行描述

- **A package name should not contain** ros **as it is redundant.** Exceptions include core packages and ROS bindings of an upstream library (e.g. moveit_ros)

  - 名字一般不应该包括ros，这是冗余的

  - 除非一些专用于与ROS系统桥接的工具包，加上ros

- **The package name should describe what the package does, not where it came from.** One of ROS's goals is to develop a canonical set of tools for making robots do interesting things. Then again, as stated in the rules below, if a package is specialized by an entity (lab, company, ...), prepend the name of the entity. But once the package is commonly used, owned and maintained, that name can be dropped as the package becomes the reference

  - 包名字应该描述包的功能，而不描述该包的来源

  - 不能写成某某大学，某某实验室等

- **Do not use a name that's already been taken.** To check whether a name is taken, consult [[2]](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0144.html#id5). If you'd like your repository included in that list, see the tutorial at [[3]](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0144.html#id6)

# 推荐规范

采用前缀/单词/后缀的方式来区分不同的包，词汇与词汇之间用下划线连接

## 前缀

- if a package is specialized for a software project, prepend its name

  - 软件项目

- if a package is specialized for a hardware piece, prepend its name

  - 硬件

- if a package is specialized for a robot, prepend its name

  - 机器人平台

- if a package is specialized by an entity (lab, company, ...), prepend the name of the entity. Once the package is commonly used, owned and maintained, that name can be dropped

  - 公司，实验室等实体

  - 如果该包影响力很大，可以把前缀去掉

## 后缀

For suffixes:

- if a package is a driver, append driver

  - 驱动

- if a package contains any of a ROS message/service/action, append msgs

  - 消息定义

- if a package is a plugin for a library, append <library_name>_plugins, e.g. pr2_gazebo_plugins

  - 插件

Special Suffixes:

- a meta package for a robot should be named <name_of_the_robot>_robot, e.g. pr2_robot

  - meta包

- a package containing the URDF and meshes of a robot should be named <name_of_the_robot>_description, e.g pr2_description

  - urdf名字为description

- if a package is meant for test only, append tests

  - 测试专用包

## 特殊场景

- a package containing only a set of launch files should end with launch

  - launch

- a package containing only a set of launch files whose goal is to start a robot should end with bringup

  - bringup，只包含launch文件

- a package containing one or more tutorials only should end with tutorials. If it is a set of tutorials for another package, it should contain that other package name: e.g. navigation and navigation_tutorials

  - tutorials

- a package containing one or more demos only should end with demos

  - demos

- third party libraries that are patched / integrated into ROS should not be named like their rosdep key as it creates a conflict across Ubuntu versions. If it is not specialized, name it generically <name_of_library>_ros

  - _ros

# 示例

The following is a list of examples following the above rules:

- A set of launch files for a wavefront planner, made for the PR2 by Willow Garage would have the following names when specializing the package more and more:

  - planner_launch

  - wavefront_planner_launch

  - pr2_wavefront_planner_launch

  - willow_garage_pr2_wavefront_planner_launch

- OpenCV 3 package, packaged for ROS: `opencv3_ros`

- a set of launch files for navigation tests: `navigation_launch_tests`
