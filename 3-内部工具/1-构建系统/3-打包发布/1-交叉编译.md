# native交叉编译

Although ROS 2 is a rich software stack with a number of dependencies, it primarily uses two different types of packages:

- Python based software, which requires no cross-compilation.

- CMake based software, which provides a mechanism to do cross-compilation.

Furthermore, the ROS 2 software stack is built with [Colcon](https://github.com/colcon/colcon-core) which provides a mechanism to forward parameters to the CMake instance used for the individual build of each package/library that is part of the ROS 2 distribution.

When building ROS 2 natively, the developer is required to download all the dependencies (e.g. Python and other libraries) before compiling the packages that are part of the ROS 2 distribution. When cross-compiling, the same approach is required. The developer must first have the target system’s filesystem with all dependencies already installed.

需要把目标平台的文件系统全部下载下来，使用交叉编译器，基于CMake的选项进行编译。

# 基于docker的交叉编译

官方提供的方法

在x86Host上编译，好像只能使用1个CPU
