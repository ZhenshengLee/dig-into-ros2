## 关于单点失效风险

roudi_daemon

[@tomoyafujita](https://discourse.ros.org/u/tomoyafujita) the daemon has pros and cons. We discuss this a lot, but we stick to it for the time being. Sure it is a single point of failure. For me this is comparable to a part of the operating system or other local services that run on one device. It has another dimension if you have a central broker like in MQTT that is needed to enable communication between different devices. Indeed the RouDi daemon is not needed for the actual communication. It does the following

- Single point of configuration. In iceoryx each subscriber can have an own queue size and different number of samples that are hold on user side. The needed size of shared memory cannot be derived per publisher but is more an overall consideration.

- Rights management. The daemon creates the shared memory partitions and can configure who is allowed to read or write which partition.

- It provides built-in topics for introspection, debugging and discovery. This could maybe also be solved without a daemon, at least DDS implementation have similar functionality without a daemon. As far as I know ROS 2 also starts a daemon when you use the command line interface. Having a central instance that aggregates the information makes things easier.

- Monitoring. As applications could crash while having loan for sample in shared memory, we use the daemon to do a monitoring and clean up

[@tomoyafujita](https://discourse.ros.org/u/tomoyafujita) Sorry for the late reply. As it was already pointed out the middleware daemon RouDi is a single point of failure. If it is shut down, everything relying on it has to be restarted (all applications depending on it will also be shut down. This holds if it crashes as well, but of course this should not happen. These aspects are a topic for a talk of its own.

There is a certain robustness guarantee in iceoryx in the sense that crashing applications will not lead to state corruption or blocking indefinitely at the dameon since the algorithms involved are lock-free. This will not necessarily hold if used within e.g. Cyclone DDS as there are still locks.

Not having RouDi as a single point of failure is a challenge. At its core it is a memory manager with lock-free transmission queues. It also keeps track of all the applications that exist and use its shared memory and some other details. To decentralize this, one would have to replicate this information at application side but there always must be some kind of consensus of the system state (which is fairly large). While this is doable it has a lot of overhead and would negate many performance advantages which are the main point of its existence.

In other words, we have to accept this single point of failure and think of the daemon as something at almost the same level as some internal OS process.

zcopy设计上的注意事项

Regarding the questions in the talk, it is rather suboptimal that crowd-cast does not allow for discussion after the talk. I therefore missed some of them entirely but I looked them up afterwards and maybe the answers are still of use.

1. Will sensor_msgs/Image be carried via ZeroCopy transport

No since sensor_msgs/Image contains a string they are not fixed (or bounded) size. We may support data types like this in some future iteration but it can never be as performant as using some fixed size type since any non-fixed size type will require a serialization operation (which a fixed-size type does not). The reason is that the data may reside in external memory in a format not suitable for shared memory transfer. I suggest using a specifically crafted fixed size message type instead.

1. If one is currently using ROS 2’s intra-process communication to achieve zero-copy transfer, is there a benefit in switching to this method?

Intra-process communication is more restricted, as it works only in the same process. Therefore this does not compete with shared memory usage which is used used for inter-process communication within the same machine (intra-machine).

I do not know the implementation but since under the hood intra-process communication can be as simple as exchanging a pointer I think it would be faster than communication via iceoryx. But as soon as we communicate between processes for sufficiently large/frequent messages there are definitely performance benefits in using iceoryx.

1. Is ZeroCopy transportation can applicable to the docker container? For example, communication between host-container or data transportation over multiple containers.

No, each docker container essentially acts as a separate machine, so shared memory communication does not work across docker containers. The reason is POSIX shared memory resources are only visible in the container itself, not in other containers. Furthermore the middleware dameon has to run within the machine which uses shared memory and running it in one container it is not able to manage applications/memory in another.

1. How do these SharedMemory settings interact with the standard ROS quality of service?

The default ROS QoS settings are Reliable, KeepLast, Volatile. These settings are supported with iceoryx (up to some limit for KeepLast). For an application there is virtually no difference in the reception of messages but potentially a performance gain.

1. Is iceoryx a version of cyclone dds?

iceoryx is an independent project but is used in Cyclone DDS. There is a project to use iceoryx without cyclonedds in ROS 2 [GitHub - ros2/rmw_iceoryx: rmw implementation for iceoryx](https://github.com/ros2/rmw_iceoryx) You can also use iceoryx without ROS 2 as an inter-process communication mechanism.

1. Is 64Kb the message fragmentation limit for cyclone dds ?

This cannot be fully explained as of now, the 64kB boundary requires further investigation and more benchmark data. At the moment we have no conclusive data as to why we see this increasing gap between network and Shared Memory transfer above 64kB message size. The current explanation is that a UDP datagram has at most this size. We also have to consider that sending a message always incurs some basic cost (waitset, semaphores, executor etc.), regardless of its size. There should be a point where this effort gets negligible compared to serialization and deserialization in the network case, but the exact point depends on many factors.

Furthermore I believe throughput already benefits from shared memory at much smaller (but frequent) messages, but the benchmark does not cover this. There is definitely some optimization potential but there is no doubt that in the case where it is supported shared memory support leads to performance gains.

所以最好使用loanedMsg api，这样可以获得更好的性能。

相比网络传输，依然节省了大量拷贝。

如果是不定长的，则一定要做一次序列化/拷贝，但是相比网络传输（loopback）来说，依然减少了多次拷贝。
